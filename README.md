# Description
This app was made as a technical assignment for a frontend role @Mindee
It allows you to add an item of your choice to a Table thanks to a form.

You can have a look quickly at https://mindee-technical-test.netlify.app.

# How to launch the app locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Install packages `npm install`
3. Use `npm start`. The project should run in `http://localhost:3000/`

# Some feature ideas
1. Make a purpose for this item list (for example a shopping list, with a price for each item and a total price)
2. Make a light/dark mode switch

# How it looks
I used some of Mindee's design system (title font, logo for the favicon, colors) and Material UI components
